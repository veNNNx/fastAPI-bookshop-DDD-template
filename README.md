# ðŸš€ FastAPI DDD Template

A clean FastAPI project template using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture.

## Features

- **FastAPI** â€“ high-performance async web framework
- **DDD structure** â€“ separation of concerns via domain/infrastructure/api layers
- **Dependency Injection** â€“ using `dependency-injector`
- **PostgreSQL** with **SQLAlchemy**
- **Testing** â€“ backend unit tests and API integration tests
- **Poetry** â€“ modern dependency and virtual environment management  
- **Pre-commit hooks** â€“ automated code quality checks and formatting before commits  

## Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions
To automate testing and code quality checks, this project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

> Runs on every pull request
- Sets up a PostgreSQL 15 service
- Installs Python 3.11 and Poetry
- Installs dependencies
- Runs pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting checks
- Executes the test suite with pytest

## Dependency Management (Poetry)

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and virtual environment management.

### Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate code quality checks and enforce best practices before commits.

### Setup

To enable pre-commit hooks locally, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
